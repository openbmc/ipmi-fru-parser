# This yaml file is manually created for parsing Barreleye BMC FRU.
# MRW does not define BMC FRU information. So this yaml cannot be generated
# from MRW like IPMI FRU.

# BMC reads the directly attached inventory data (refer to as 'BMC FRU') from
# I2C in IPMI FRU Information format.
# This file maps the 'BMC FRU' data to properties of Openbmc Inventory Interface
# defined in phosphor-dbus-interface.
#
# BMC FRU shares the same parser with IPMI FRU (FRU managed by Host).
#
# 'inventory.py' uses this file to generate c++ data structures for FRU parser.
# The parser translates IPMI FRU information into properties defined in openbmc
# inventory interface. Then the parser registers inventory object with
# phosphor-inventory-manager.


# This FRUID key is meaningless for BMC FRU.
# Defined here just to make FRU parser work
# Since the parser only accepts FRUID as type 'uint8_t', keep the FRUID defined
# in legency Skeleton code.
